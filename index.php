	<h1> About Charles</h1>
	<body> <p> I am 34 years old, I was born in South Dakota and my parents moved to Arizona when I was 3 years old.
		At 18 I joined the Navy and spent 6 years at various bases around the world. I decided to leave the military and
		join the professional world with a large defense contractor. I disliked the job and decided to make a move to New
		Mexico and go to work as a consultant for a non-profit that focused on economic development. </p>

		<p> I decided in order to help my professional development I would take the Deep Dive Coding course in order
		to add to my skill set and help become more marketable to employers. </p>
